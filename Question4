Question 4:AT&T was running commercials in 1990 aimed at luring back customers who had switched to one of the other long-distance phone service providers. One such commercial shows a businessman trying to reach Phoenix and mistakenly getting Fiji, where a half-naked native on a beach responds incomprehensibly in Polynesian. When asked about this advertisement, AT&T admitted that the portrayed incident did not actually take place but added that this was an enactment of something that “could happen.” Suppose that one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected. What is the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number? (Assume independence of attempts.)

Answer: one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected

probability of call misdirecting  p = 1/200

Probability of call not Misdirecting = 1 - 1/200 = 199/200

Number of Calls = 5

P(x) = ⁿCₓpˣqⁿ⁻ˣ

n = 5

p = 1/200

q = 199/200

at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number

= 1  -  none of the call reaches the wrong number

= 1  - P(0)

= 1   -  ⁵C₀(1/200)⁰(199/200)⁵⁻⁰

= 1  -  (199/200)⁵

= 0.02475
